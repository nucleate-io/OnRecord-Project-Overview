# OnRecord-Project-Overview
Overview of our work with OnRecord

Live site is available at [onrecord.online](https://onrecord.online/)

Most functionality is behind signup, so below are a few screenshots some the different pages.
(I'm actively working on this, More will be coming shortly)

Upon signing up and completing the form, users will be taken to the home page of the app

This page shows the graph-based interface that is central to most of the apps functionality. 
The central node always remains fixed, with peripheral nodes floating nearby, spaced around the central node according to the nubmer of nodes. 
This interface was entirely custom, and was implemented larely using Framer Motion, which allowed us to create entrance/exit animations and subtle
floating animations that make the interface seem natural and welcoming. 

The peripheral nodes on this page represent bands that you have been matched into. Clicking on it will take the user to that band's page.
